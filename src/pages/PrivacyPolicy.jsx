        <Typography>
          Like most websites, SnapJSON collects non-personal information about
          users when they access the platform. This may include browser type,
          operating system, and internet service provider details to improve the
          user experience.

          Cookies
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          SnapJSON uses cookies to track user preferences and optimize
          performance. Users can configure their browsers to refuse cookies or
          notify them when a cookie is sent.

          Data Collection
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          SnapJSON does not store or retain any JSON data submitted by users.
          Any data processed within the tool remains on the client-side and is
          not stored on our servers.

          Third-Party Services
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          We may use third-party services such as Google Analytics for traffic
          analysis and performance monitoring. These services may collect
          non-personal data to improve SnapJSONâ€™s functionality.

          Security
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          We implement industry-standard security measures to protect user data.
          However, since SnapJSON does not store JSON data, privacy is
          inherently ensured.

        <Typography>
          SnapJSON may display advertisements via third-party ad networks. These
          ads may use cookies to provide relevant content but do not track or
          store personal information.
